## Requirements

* [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org)
* [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip) >= 19.1
* [setuptools-rust](https://pypi.org/project/setuptools-rust/) >= 0.10.2
* Make sure you have fulfilled the [Rust Getting Started](rust.mdx) requirements to compile the binding.

## Install the Library

### Clone the Repository

You can clone the [wallet.rs client library](https://github.com/iotaledger/wallet.rs) by running the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iotaledger/wallet.rs
```

### Change to the Python Binding Directory

After you have cloned the repository, you should change directory to `wallet.rs/bindings/python`. You can do so
by
running the following command:

```bash
cd wallet.rs/bindings/python
```

#### (optional) Create and use a virtual environment

If you want to isolate the library from the rest of your system, you can create a virtual environment by running the
following commands:

```bash
python3 -m venv iota_wallet_venv
````
##### Linux and macOS

```bash
source iota_wallet_venv/bin/activate
```

##### Windows

```bash
.\iota_wallet_venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Install the Required Dependencies and Build the Wheel

Once you have [cloned the library](#clone-the-library),
and [moved to the binding's directory](#change-to-the-python-binding-directory), you should install dependencies and
build the wheel file.

You can do so by running the following commands:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pip install .
```

#### (optional) Deactivate the virtual environment

If you want to deactivate the virtual environment, you should run the following command from the virtual environment:

```bash
deactivate
```

## Use the Library

After you have [installed the library](#install-the-library), you can create a `IotaWallet` instance and interact with
it.

```python
from iota_wallet import IotaWallet, StrongholdSecretManager

NODE_URL = "https://api.testnet.shimmer.network"
STORAGE_PATH = "walletdb"
STRONGHOLD_SNAPSHOT_PATH = "vault.stronghold"
SHIMMER_COIN_TYPE = 4219

# Change to a secure password.
password = "some-secure-password"

# Setup Stronghold secret manager
secret_manager = StrongholdSecretManager(STRONGHOLD_SNAPSHOT_PATH, password)

client_options = {
    'nodes': [NODE_URL],
}

# Set up and store the wallet.
wallet = IotaWallet(STORAGE_PATH, client_options, SHIMMER_COIN_TYPE, secret_manager)

# Generate a mnemonic and store it in the Stronghold vault.
mnemonic = wallet.generate_mnemonic()
wallet.store_mnemonic(mnemonic)

# Create an account and get the first address.
wallet.create_account('Alice')
account = wallet.get_account('Alice')

address = account.addresses()[0]

# Print the account data.
print(f'Mnemonic:\n{mnemonic}\n')
print(f'Address:\n{address["address"]}\n')
```

## What's Next?

Now that you are up and running, you can get acquainted with the library using
its [how-to guides](../how_tos/run_how_tos.mdx) and the
repository's [code examples](https://github.com/iotaledger/wallet.rs/tree/develop/bindings/python/examples).
