# Welcome

This is the documentation for the official IOTA SDK. The documentation can be used to easily interact with the Tangle. You can read more about core principles behind the IOTA SDK in the following [blog post](https://blog.iota.org/the-new-iota-client-libraries-harder-better-faster-stronger/).

:::caution
Use Stronghold for secrets management. It integrates the best security practices and is open-source.
:::

`Stronghold` can store the encrypted seed at rest. It is not possible to extract the seed from `Stronghold` for security purposes. `Stronghold` uses encrypted snapshots that can easily be backed up and securely shared between devices. These snapshots are further secured with a password.
