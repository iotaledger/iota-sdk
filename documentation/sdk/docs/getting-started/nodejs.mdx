# Getting Started with Node.js

<WarningPasswordStorage/>

## Requirements

- One of the following Node.js versions: '16.x', '18.x';

## Install the IOTA SDK

### Install Using a Package Manager

To start using the IOTA SDK in your Node.js project, you can install the IOTA SDK from your package manager of choice:

### npm

```sh
npm i @iota/sdk
```

### Yarn

```sh
yarn add @iota/sdk
```

### Build the Binding from Source

#### Requirements

If you want to build the IOTA SDK from source, please ensure you have the installed the following:

* A [supported version of Node and Rust](https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon#platform-support).
* Python < 3.11
* Yarn v1

#### Windows

On Windows, you will also need an LLVM. Our workflow uses
`https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases/download/llvmorg-11.0.1/LLVM-11.0.1-win64.exe`. You may also need to set
an environment variable `RUSTFLAGS` to `-C target-feature=+crt-static`.

#### Build

You can build the IOTA SDK from source by doing the following:

1. Download the repository to any directory you choose:

 ```shell
 git clone https://github.com/iotaledger/iota-sdk
    ```

2. Move to the Node.js binding directory:

 ```shell
cd iota-sdk/bindings/nodejs
    ```

3. Install the necessary dependencies with either of the following commands:

 ```shell
 npm install
    ```
 ```shell
 yarn install
    ```

4. Build the SDK:

 ```shell
 npm run build
    ```

This command uses the [cargo-cp-artifact](https://github.com/neon-bindings/cargo-cp-artifact) utility to run the Rust
build and copy the built library into `./build/Release/index.node`.
Prebuild requires that the binary is in `build/Release` as though it was built with node-gyp.

## Usage

### Client

After you [installed the library](#install-the-iota-sdk), you can create a `Client` instance and interface with it.

```javascript
const { Client, initLogger } = require('@iota/sdk');

async function run() {
    initLogger();

    const client = new Client({
        nodes: ['https://api.testnet.shimmer.network'],
        localPow: true,
    });

    try {
        const nodeInfo = await client.getInfo();
        console.log('Node info: ', nodeInfo);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error: ', error);
    }
}

run().then(() => process.exit());
```

### Wallet

After you [installed the library](#installing-the-iota-sdk), you can create a `Wallet` instance and interact with it.

```javascript
import {  Wallet, CoinType, WalletOptions } from '@iota/sdk';

const walletOptions: WalletOptions = {
    storagePath: `Alice`, // A name to associate with the created account.
    clientOptions: {
        nodes: ['https://api.testnet.shimmer.network'], // The node to connect to.
    },
    coinType: CoinType.Shimmer,
    secretManager: {
        // Setup Stronghold secret manager
        stronghold: {
            snapshotPath: 'vault.stronghold', //  The path to store the account snapshot.
            password: 'a-secure-password', // A password to encrypt the stored data. WARNING: Never hardcode passwords in production code.
        },
    },
};
const wallet = new Wallet(walletOptions);
```

### How-To Guides

Once you have [installed the IOTA SDK](#install-the-iota-sdk), you can start building your application. You can find
usage examples in this Wiki's [how-to guides](../how_tos/accounts_and_addresses/create_mnemonic.mdx).

### More Examples

You can use the provided code [examples](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota-sdk/tree/develop/bindings/nodejs/examples) to get acquainted with the IOTA SDK. You can use the following command to run any example:

```bash
cd examples
yarn run-example ./[example folder]/[example file]
```

- Where `[example file]` is the file name from the example folder. For example:

```bash
yarn run-example  examples/client/00_get_info.ts
```
