# Rust API Reference

The IOTA SDK Rust API Reference is in the [crate documentation](https://docs.rs/iota-sdk/latest/iota_sdk/).

If you would like to explore the implementation in more depth, you can generate docs for the whole crate by running the
following command:

```shell
cargo doc --document-private-items --no-deps --open
```
