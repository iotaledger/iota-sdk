# Testnet and Test Tokens

## Connect to the Testnet API

We recommended that you start your interactions with Shimmer on a _testnet_ network. The _testnet_ will allow you to
safely get acquainted with the `wallet.rs` library, without the risk of losing any funds if you make a mistake along the
way.

You can use this public load-balanced Shimmer Testnet API:

```plaintext
https://api.testnet.shimmer.network
```

## Explore the Network

You can use the [Shimmer Tangle Explorer](https://explorer.shimmer.network/testnet) to view transactions and data stored
in the Tangle.

## Get Test Tokens

In order to properly test value-based transactions on testnet network, you are going to need some tokens. You can get
some testnet tokens through the [Shimmer Faucet](https://faucet.testnet.shimmer.network).
