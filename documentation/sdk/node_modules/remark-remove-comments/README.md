[**Remark**](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark) plugin to remove HTML comments from the processed output.

## Install

[npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install):

```sh
npm install remark-remove-comments
```

## Use

Say we have the following file, `example.md`:

```markdown
# Hello World

This is a markdown file, with text in it.

<!-- But in this file there's a comment, like "TODO: fix ðŸ˜…",
  I don't want this to appear in the HTML output, it's just for me -->
```

And our script, `example.js`, looks as follows:

```js
const fs = require('fs');
const remark = require('remark');
const removeComments = require('remark-remove-comments');

remark()
  .use(removeComments)
  .process(fs.readFileSync('example.md', 'utf-8'), function (err, file) {
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log(String(file));
  });
```

Now, running `node example` yields:

```markdown
# Hello World

This is a markdown file, with text in it.
```
