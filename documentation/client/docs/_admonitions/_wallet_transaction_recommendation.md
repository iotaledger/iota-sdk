:::info Wallet.rs

Though it is possible to send transactions with `iota.rs`, we strongly recommend that you use the official
[`wallet.rs`](https://wiki.iota.org/shimmer/wallet.rs/welcome) library together with the
[`stronghold.rs`](https://wiki.iota.org/stronghold.rs/welcome) enclave for value-based transfers. This combination
incorporates the best security practices while dealing with seeds, related addresses, and UTXO.
