## Requirements

* [Rust and Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html).
* (for Linux only) `libudev`. You can install it with `apt install libudev-dev`.

## Include the Library in Your `Cargo.toml`

The only thing you need to do to start using the library is to add it as dependency in your `Cargo.toml` file:

```bash
[dependencies]
iota-client = { git = "https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.rs", branch = "develop" }
tokio = { version = "1.22.0", features = [ "full" ] }
```

## Use the Library

This example fetches node information.

```rust
use iota_client::{Client, Result};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<()> {
    // Create a client with that node.
    let client = Client::builder()
        .with_node("https://api.testnet.shimmer.network")?
        .with_ignore_node_health()
        .finish()?;

    // Get node info.
    let info = client.get_info().await?;

    // Print node info.
    println!("{info:#?}");

    Ok(())
}
```

## What's Next?

Now that you are up and running, you can get acquainted with the library using
its [how-to guides](../how_tos/00_run_how_tos.mdx) and the
repository's [code examples](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.rs/tree/develop/examples).
