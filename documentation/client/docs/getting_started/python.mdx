## Requirements

* [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org).
* [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip).

## Install package from PyPI

You can install the library by executing `pip install iota-client`.

## Install from source

:::caution

We recommend to install the library with [pip from PyPI](#install-package-from-pypi). 
Only compile the library from source if you are in need of some unreleased features or are working with an unsupported computer architecture.

:::

### Additional Requirements

* [Rust and Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html).
* (for Linux only) `libudev`. You can install it with `apt install libudev-dev`.

### Clone the Repository

You can clone the [iota.rs client library](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.rs) by running the following command:

```bash
git clone -b develop https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.rs
```

### Change to the Python Binding Directory

After you have cloned the repository, you should change directory to `iota.rs/client/bindings/python`. You can do so by
running the following command:

```bash
cd iota.rs/client/bindings/python
```

### Install the Required Dependencies and Build the Wheel

Once you have [cloned the repository](#clone-the-repository),
and [moved to the binding's directory](#change-to-the-python-binding-directory), you should install dependencies and build the wheel file.

You can do so by running the following commands:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pip install .
```

### (optional) Create and Use a Virtual Environment

If you want to isolate the library from the rest of your system, you can create a virtual environment by running the
following commands:

#### Linux/MacOs

```bash
python3 -m venv iota_client_venv
source iota_client_venv/bin/activate
```

#### Windows

```shell
.\iota_client_venv\Scripts\activate
```

### (optional) Deactivate the virtual environment

If you want to deactivate the virtual environment, you should run the following command from the virtual environment:

```bash
deactivate
```

## Use the Library

After you installed the library, you can create a `IotaClient` instance and interface with it.

```python
from iota_client import IotaClient

# Create an IotaClient instance
client = IotaClient({'nodes': ['https://api.testnet.shimmer.network']})

# Get the node info
node_info = client.get_info()
print(f'{node_info}')
```

## What's Next?

Now that you are up and running, you can get acquainted with the library using
its [how-to guides](../how_tos/00_run_how_tos.mdx) and the
repository's [code examples](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.rs/tree/develop/bindings/nodejs/examples).
