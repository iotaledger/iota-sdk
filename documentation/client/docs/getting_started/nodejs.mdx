import WarningPasswordStorage from '../_admonitions/_password_storage.md';

<WarningPasswordStorage />

## Requirements

* One of the following [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) versions:
    * '14.x'
    * '16.x' (LTS) .
    * '18.x' (Current).

* [Rust and Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html) to compile the binding.

## Install the Library

You can install the library using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) with the following
commands:

### npm

```bash
npm i @iota/client
```

### Yarn

```bash
yarn add @iota/client
```

## Use the Library

After you have linked the library, you can create a [`Client`](./../libraries/nodejs/references/classes/Client.md)
instance and interface with it.

```javascript
import { Client } from '@iota/client';

const client = new Client({
    nodes: ['https://api.testnet.shimmer.network'],
});

client.getInfo().then(console.log).catch(console.error)
```

## Connecting to MQTT

Connecting to a MQTT broker using a raw ip doesn't work with TCP. This is a limitation
of [rustls](https://docs.rs/rustls/latest/rustls/).

## What's Next?

Now that you are up and running, you can get acquainted with the library using
its [how-to guides](../how_tos/00_run_how_tos.mdx) and the
repository's [code examples](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.rs/tree/develop/bindings/nodejs/examples).
