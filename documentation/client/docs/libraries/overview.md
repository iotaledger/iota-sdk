# IOTA Client libraries

Choose your programming language:

- [Rust](../getting_started/rust.mdx) 
- [Node.js](../getting_started/nodejs.mdx)
- [Java](../getting_started/java.mdx)
- [Python](../getting_started/python.mdx)

## Connect to the Testnet API

We recommended that you start your interactions with Shimmer on a _testnet_ network. The _testnet_ will allow you to safely
get acquainted with the library, without the risk of losing any funds if you make a mistake along the way.
You can use this Shimmer Testnet API load balancer:

```plaintext
https://api.testnet.shimmer.network
```

## Explore the Network

You can use the [Shimmer Tangle Explorer](https://explorer.shimmer.network/testnet) to view transactions and data stored in the Tangle.

## Get Test Tokens

If you plan on managing funds in your application, take a look at
our [wallet.rs library](https://wiki.iota.org/wallet.rs/welcome) instead.

In any case, to properly test value-based transactions on testnet network, you are going to need some tokens. You can get some testnet tokens through the [Shimmer Faucet](https://faucet.testnet.shimmer.network).
