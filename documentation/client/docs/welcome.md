# Welcome

![IOTA Client Library](/img/Banner/banner_client_lib.png)

The iota.rs library handles communications between your software and the IOTA network.

The iota.rs library is free and open-source, and it will be. Both the IOTA Foundation and the IOTA community maintain
the library and this wiki, which means that you can rely on it as a source of knowledge on iota.rs. Start exploring it
from the [Overview](overview.md) page.

If you have questions, jump into a discussion or start a new one on our [Discord server](https://discord.iota.org) or
ask questions and find answers at our [community on Stack Exchange](https://iota.stackexchange.com/). If you wish to
contribute to the project, make sure that you read our [contribution guide](./contribute.md).

We are glad that you are here!
