    force_syncing :
        Usually syncing is skipped if it's called in between 200ms, because there can only be new
        changes every milestone and calling it twice "at the same time" will not return new data.
        When this is set to true, we will sync anyways, even if it's called 0ms after the last sync
        finished.
    sync_incoming_transactions :
        Try to sync transactions from incoming outputs with their inputs. Some data may not be obtained
        if it has been pruned.
    sync_pending_transactions :
        Checks pending transactions.
    account :
        Specifies what outputs should be synced for the address of an account output.
    wallet :
        Specifies what outputs should be synced for the address of an account output.
    nft :
        Specifies what outputs should be synced for the address of an nft output.
    sync_only_most_basic_outputs :
        Specifies if only basic outputs with just an address unlock condition should be synced.
        This will overwrite the `wallet`, `alias` and `nft` options.
    sync_native_token_foundries :
        Sync native token foundries, so their metadata can be returned in the balance.
    sync_implicit_accounts :
        Sync implicit accounts.
