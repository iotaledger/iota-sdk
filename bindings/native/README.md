# IOTA SDK Native

This binding wraps the IOTA SDK into a native, shared library.

It can be referenced by other languages such as Go, C/C++ or C#.

It exports the following functions:

```
init_logger
binding_get_last_error

call_client_method
call_secret_manager_method
call_utils_method
call_wallet_method

create_client
create_secret_manager
create_wallet
listen_wallet

destroy_client
destroy_secret_manager
destroy_string
destroy_wallet

get_client_from_wallet
get_secret_manager_from_wallet
```

Generated C/C++ headers can be found under `bindings/native/headers`.

Headers can be regenerated by running `bindings/native/bindgen.sh`. This requires [cbindgen](https://github.com/mozilla/cbindgen/).

An example implementation in Go can be found [here](https://github.com/iotaledger/wasp-wallet-sdk/blob/main/wrapper.go).

# Usage

All strings need to be null terminated.

All strings coming from the library need to be free'd by calling `destroy_string` after receiving and copying them.

Any function that either returns a `NULL` pointer or `false` might have catched an error.

This error can be obtained via `get_last_error`.
