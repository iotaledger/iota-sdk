# IOTA SDK Library

[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/iotaledger/iota-sdk/badge.svg?branch=develop)](https://coveralls.io/github/iotaledger/iota-sdk?branch=develop)

The IOTA SDK is a Rust-based project that provides a convenient and efficient way to interact with nodes in the
Shimmer and IOTA networks running
the [Stardust protocol](https://wiki.iota.org/shimmer/develop/explanations/what-is-stardust). It consists of two main
modules: `client` and `wallet`.

## Features

- **Client module**: The `client` module in the IOTA SDK offers low-level functions that allow you to have
  fine-grained control over your interactions with Shimmer nodes. The module is stateless. It provides access to the
  underlying API endpoints and enables advanced operations such as custom message construction and direct communication
- with the network.

- **Wallet module**: The `wallet` module in the IOTA SDK provides high-level functions for managing accounts, generating
  addresses, creating transactions, and interacting with the Shimmer network. It offers a user-friendly interface for
  developers to build applications on the Shimmer network. It is stateful, and it can optionally interact
  with [IOTA Stronghold](https://github.com/iotaledger/stronghold.rs/) for seed handling, storage, and state backup.

- **Python, Node.js, and WASM Bindings**: The IOTA SDK includes bindings for Python, Node.js, and WASM, which allow you
  to use the SDK in your preferred programming language. These bindings provide seamless integration with existing Python and
  Node.js projects, enabling cross-platform compatibility and flexibility.

## Branching Structure for Development

This library follows the following branching strategy:

| Branch       | Description                                                                                                                    |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `develop`    | Ongoing development for future releases of the staging networks. This branch gets merged into `staging` on releases.           |
| `production` | The latest releases for the IOTA network.                                                                                      |
| `staging`    | The latest releases for the Shimmer network.                                                                                   |
| other        | Other branches that may reflect current projects. Like `develop`, they will find their way into `staging` once they are ready. |

## Before You Start

This file is focused on Rust. Please refer to
the [Python](bindings/python/README.md), [Node.js](bindings/nodejs/README.md) and [Wasm](bindings/wasm/README.md)
instructions if you want information on installing and using them.

## Requirements

The IOTA SDK requires `Rust` and `Cargo`. You can find installation instructions in
the [Rust documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html).

We recommend that you update the Rust compiler to the latest stable version first:

```shell
rustup update stable
```

### Dependencies

You must also install `cmake`, `clang`, and `openssl`. You may need to install additional build tools on your system to
run the build process successfully using Cargo.

#### Windows

You can download `cmake` from the [official website](https://cmake.org/download/). You can install `openssl`
with [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) or [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/).

- Installing `openssl` with `vcpkg`:

```
./vcpkg.exe install openssl:x64-windows
./vcpkg.exe integrate install
# You may want to add this to the system environment variables since you'll need it to compile the crate
set VCPKGRS_DYNAMIC=1
```

- Installing `openssl` with `chocolatey`:

```
choco install openssl
# You may need to set the OPENSSL_DIR environment variable
set OPENSSL_DIR="C:\Program Files\OpenSSL-Win64"
```

#### macOS

You can install `cmake` and `openssl` with `Homebrew`:

```
brew install cmake openssl@1.1
```

#### Linux

You can install `cmake`, `clang`, and `openssl` with your distro's package manager or download them from their websites.
On Debian and Ubuntu, you will also need the `build-essential` and `libudev-dev` packages.

## Getting Started

### Install the IOTA SDK

To start using the IOTA SDK in your Rust project, you can include the following dependencies in your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
iota-sdk = { git = "https://github.com/iotaledger/iota-sdk" branch = "develop" }
```

### Usage

#### Client

To use the Client module, you simply need to create a `Client`.

```rust
use iota_sdk::client::{
    Client,
};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<()> {
    let client = Client::builder()
        .with_node('https://api.testnet.shimmer.network')? // Insert your node URL here
        .finish()
        .await?;
            
    let info = client.get_info().await?;
    println!("Node Info: {info:?}")
    
    Ok(())
}
```

#### Wallet

To use the Wallet module, you need to create a `Wallet`:

```rust
use iota_sdk::{
    client::{
        constants::SHIMMER_COIN_TYPE,
        secret::{stronghold::StrongholdSecretManager, SecretManager},
    },
    wallet::{ClientOptions, Result, Wallet},
};
use std::path::PathBuf;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<()> {
    // Setup Stronghold secret manager.
    let secret_manager = StrongholdSecretManager::builder()
        .password("vault.stronghold") // A password to encrypt the stored data.WARNING: Never hardcode passwords in production code.
        .build(PathBuf::from("vault.stronghold"))?; // The path to store the account snapshot.

    let client_options = ClientOptions::new().with_node("https://api.testnet.shimmer.network")?;// The node to connect to.

    // Set up and store the wallet.
    let wallet = Wallet::builder()
        .with_secret_manager(SecretManager::Stronghold(secret_manager))
        .with_client_options(client_options)
        .with_coin_type(SHIMMER_COIN_TYPE)
        .finish()
        .await?;

    // Generate a mnemonic and store it in the Stronghold vault.
    // INFO: It is best practice to back up the mnemonic somewhere secure.
    let mnemonic = wallet.generate_mnemonic()?;
    wallet.store_mnemonic(mnemonic).await?;

    // Create an account.
    let account = wallet
        .create_account()
        .with_alias("Alice".to_string()) // A name to associate with the created account.
        .finish()
        .await?;


    Ok(())
}
```

#### Examples

You can use the provided code [examples](sdk/examples) to get acquainted with the IOTA SDK. You can use the following
command to run any example:

```bash
cargo run --example example_name --release
```

* Where `example_name` is the name from the [Cargo.toml](sdk/Cargo.toml) name from the example folder. For example:

```bash
cargo run --example node_api_core_get_info --release 
```

You can get a list of the available code examples with the following command:

```bash
cargo run --example
```

### API Reference

#### Rust

The IOTA SDK Rust API Reference is in the [crate documentation](https://docs.rs/iota-sdk/latest/iota_sdk/).
